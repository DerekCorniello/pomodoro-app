# Study Timer App

## Overview

Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, this app helps students manage their study time effectively. It includes features for setting specific times for studying and breaks, with notifications to keep users on track. Additional features include a to-do list, history of study time, and a calendar. A typical pomodoro session consists of four sessions: three cycles of 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5 minutes of rest, and the fourth session allows for a longer 30-minute break.

## Platforms

The project utilizes Electron.js for full-stack development to create a web interface deployable on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Electron.js is a leading framework for building cross-platform applications, offering access to system APIs and native desktop application capabilities.
